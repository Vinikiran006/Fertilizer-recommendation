🌱 Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project is a machine learning-based system that recommends the most suitable fertilizer for a given crop and soil condition.
It uses environmental and soil parameters such as temperature, humidity, moisture, soil type, crop type, and nutrient values (N, P, K) to predict the fertilizer that will maximize crop yield.

The project integrates:

Backend (Flask API) to serve ML predictions

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for user interaction

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn / XGBoost) for model training

🚀 Features

Accepts soil, crop, and environmental parameters as input

Predicts the best fertilizer for the given conditions

Flask-powered API for serving predictions

Simple and interactive frontend for user input

Easy deployment on cloud platforms (Render, Railway, AWS, etc.)
